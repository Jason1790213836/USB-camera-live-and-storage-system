# USB-camera-live-and-storage-system
Developed a recording system based on Raspberry Pi 5 and the Thonny compiler, using GPIO pins to control the start and stop of audio recording. The system automatically saves each recording to a USB flash drive for local storage, enabling standalone operation without Wi-Fi connectivity.
